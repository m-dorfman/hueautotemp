## about

Automation of Philips Hue eco to help adjust circadian rhythm.

`autohue_aws_deploy` is the AWS deployment variant.

Other branches in this project are to deploy on RPI and developing a django app to interact with.

Melanopsin(subfamily of the Opsin proteins) is a photosensitive protein found in mammalian retina. When light contacts the human eyes, melonopsin reacts according to the presence of blue light, with peak light absorption at 480nm. As light absorption of melonopsin is increased, a negative correlative relationship with melatonin is exhibited. In other words: the closer we get to 480nm blue light, the brain releases less melatonin, while a decrease from 480nm increases the release of melatonin in the mammalian brain.

As we can see, melanopsin can be partially responsible for the control of circadian rhythm.

By adjusting the amount of blue/red light in cyclical/phasic fashion during the day, we can potentially manipulate our own circadian rhythm. This could be beneficial for anyone hoping to potentially more productive, or to maybe feel better. Those with seasonal depression may find great benefit from such a system.
