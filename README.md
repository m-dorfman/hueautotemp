Melanopsin(subfamily of the Opsin proteins) is a photosensitive prortein found in mammalian retina.
When light contacts the huma eyes, melonopsin reacts according to the presence of blue light, with peak light absorption at 480nm. As light absorption of melonopson is increased, a negative correlative relationship with melatonin is exhibited.
In other words: the closer we get to 480nm blue light, the brain releases less melatonin, while .
