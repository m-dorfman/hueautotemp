Automation of Philips Hue eco to help adjust circadian rhythm. 


Melanopsin(subfamily of the Opsin proteins) is a photosensitive prortein found in mammalian retina.
When light contacts the huma eyes, melonopsin reacts according to the presence of blue light, with peak light absorption at 480nm. As light absorption of melonopson is increased, a negative correlative relationship with melatonin is exhibited.
In other words: the closer we get to 480nm blue light, the brain releases less melatonin, while a decrease from 480nm increases the release of melatonin in the mammalian brain.
As we can see, melanopsin can be partially responsible for the control of circadian rhythm.

By adjusting the amount of blue light in cyclical/phasic fashion during the day, we can potentially manipulate our own circadian rhythm.
